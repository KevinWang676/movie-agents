            "\n",
            "1. **Similar Movie Analysis**\n",
            "   - I identified similar films to your project: \"Some Girl(s)\" (2013), \"The Rat Race\" (1960), and \"Straight from the Heart\" (2003). These films share thematic elements like romance and personal discovery but achieved minimal box office results, likely due to niche appeal or limited release.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Inflation Adjustment**\n",
            "   - While historical box office figures are adjusted for inflation, the minimal earnings of these similar films suggest that your movie might face similar challenges in capturing a broad audience.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Monte Carlo Simulation**\n",
            "   - This simulation computes various scenarios to estimate the spread of potential outcomes. Unfortunately, the current data indicates a high probability (100%) that the movie might not achieve even twice its budget, meaning it poses significant financial risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Financial Risk Warning\n",
            "\n",
            "Given the estimation, there’s a 0% likelihood of the movie's revenue exceeding three times the average budget of comparable projects, with an overwhelming 100% probability of falling below twice the budget. This indicates a high-risk venture where achieving profitability is uncertain.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Recommendation\n",
            "\n",
            "- Consider increasing the film's appeal through marketing or casting well-known actors.\n",
            "- Explore distribution through streaming platforms where niche films often find a dedicated audience.\n",
            "- Factor in audience preferences and current market trends to enhance box office potential.\n",

            "Our predictive model uses data from movies with analogous themes and elements. Here’s how your film matches:\n",
            "\n",
            "- **\"The English Patient\" (1996)**: A historical romance with a total box office of $232 million. It shares the historical backdrop and depth of character exploration, albeit in a romantic context.\n",
            "- **\"Promising Young Woman\" (2020)**: Though contemporary, it features a strong female lead with unexpected twists, earning approximately $19 million.\n",
            "- **\"Black Widow\" (2021)**: Involves a strong female protagonist with a focus on uncovering hidden histories, grossing $379 million globally.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 2. **Inflation Adjustments:**\n",
            "Revenue for older films, like \"The English Patient,\" is adjusted for inflation to provide a fair comparison. This adjustment allows us to understand potential revenue in today’s market more accurately.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 3. **Monte Carlo Simulations:**\n",
            "We perform Monte Carlo simulations to understand the probabilistic outcomes for box office performance under various scenarios, accounting for uncertainties like market conditions and audience reception.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Predicted Revenue:\n",
            "- **Estimated Gross**: $121.25 million\n",
            "- **Confidence Interval**: Between $115.20 million and $127.32 million\n",
            "\n",
            "### Risk Assessment:\n",
            "- **Probability Exceeding 3x Budget**: 100%\n",
            "- **Probability Below 2x Budget**: 0%\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Interpretation:\n",
            "- The historical context and unique story of a forgotten heroine resonate well with audiences, projecting solid returns.\n",
            "- The revenue is conservatively estimated to be well above the average budget for historical dramas.\n",
            "- Our risk probabilities suggest a robust return on investment (ROI), with almost negligible chances of falling below a profitable threshold.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Final Recommendation:\n",
            "The unique narrative combined with historical intrigue positions your film for a favorable box office performance. Given the strong presumed ROI and negligible downside risk, your project appears financially promising.\n",

This adjustment allows us to understand potential revenue in today’s market more accurately.\\n\\n#### 3. **Monte Carlo Simulations:**\\nWe perform Monte Carlo simulations to understand the probabilistic outcomes for box office performance under various scenarios, accounting for uncertainties like market conditions and audience reception.\\n\\n### Predicted Revenue:\\n- **Estimated Gross**: $121.25 million\\n- **Confidence Interval**: Between $115.20 million and $127.32 million\\n\\n### Risk Assessment:\\n- **Probability Exceeding 3x Budget**: 100%\\n- **Probability Below 2x Budget**: 0%\\n\\n#### Interpretation:\\n- The historical context and unique story of a forgotten heroine resonate well with audiences, projecting solid returns.\\n- The revenue is conservatively estimated to be well above the average budget for historical dramas.\\n- Our risk probabilities suggest a robust return on investment (ROI), with almost negligible chances of falling below a profitable threshold.\\n\\n### Final Recommendation:\\nThe unique narrative combined with historical intrigue positions your film for a favorable box office performance.
